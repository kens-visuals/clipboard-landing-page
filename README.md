## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I liked the layout of this project, it was pretty simple and had a lot of white space, which is one of my favorite aspects in web design. I didn't necessarily learn much, I should say that I practiced more. I practice more on scroll-in animations with JS. Again, nothing crazy, I just thought this is another great opportunity to practice some new skills and build a good fundamental knowledge about them with these simple projects.

### Useful resources

- [The Auto Slider Animation](https://codepen.io/kens-visuals/pen/gOGxpmJ?editors=1100) - Check ot my CodePen to see how I did the logos' slider animation.
